**Delphi Robot Arm Tic-Tac-Toe** is a graphical Tic-Tac-Toe game built in Delphi VCL, featuring a robot arm that plays against the user. The game is designed with two dashboardsâ€”one where the robotic arm places Xs, and one where the human player places Os. The robot arm is visually animated to simulate realistic movement for each turn.

## Features

* **Interactive Gameplay:** Classic 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe game between a user and a simulated robot arm.
* **Dual Dashboards:** Separate visual zones for the robot (X) and user (O) moves.
* **Robot Arm Animation:** The robot arm moves and places Xs on the board with smooth motion.
* **Visual Feedback:** All moves are displayed in real time using VCL shapes and motion simulation.
